    <h1>Welcome To Full Stack Course</h1>
    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>A full stack developer is an engineer who can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems engineering, and
        clients.

        As one of the hottest topics for developers, the discussions have never stopped. On LinkedIn and Facebook, lots
        of people put their job title as a full stack developer. Besides, it seems that the “Full Stack” topic has
        already become a new job trend. An article on Medium has discussed the full stack designer getting both praise
        and blame. Some people think that the full stack is just a title, what he/she should focus on is the real
        personal ability and technology.
        Essentially, I think the discussion about the full stack is also a kind of argument relating to the all-rounder
        and expert in the IT industry, and debate on the depth and breadth of development skills.
